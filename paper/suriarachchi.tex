% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

% Questions regarding SIGS should be sent to

\title{DEBS Grand Challenge: A High-Throughput, Scalable Solution for Calculating Frequent Routes and Profitability of New York Taxis}
%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{2} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\begin{abstract}
Processing complex queries on unbounded event streams in real-time, is a challenge for many data processing systems. These systems are expected to process data with reduced latency to generate real-time events, and at high throughput to minimize the required hardware. In this regard, DEBS Grand Challenge 2015 focuses on evaluating two queries (frequent routes and  profitable cells) in real-time with low latency and high throughput. These queries involve processing windows of thousands of records. Firstly, such processing demands efficient data structures and algorithms to minimize the processing overhead. Secondly, the system should partition data to evaluate them in parallel to make it scalable.

In this paper, we present a set of data structures that we designed to evaluate the aforementioned queries with O(log n) time complexity and a data partitioning technique to evaluate them in parallel. We then evaluate our solution on a single machine as well as in a distributed setting in a commodity cluster of machines over a 1Gbps LAN. We were able to process the frequent routes query with the 173 million trips dataset within 5 minutes with less than 4 millisecond latency and the profitable cells query with same dataset within 11 minutes with less than 5 millisecond latency.
